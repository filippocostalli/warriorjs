My solution for warriorjs game

I spent a night - I mean, not a whole night, only some hours - driving Balder throught the floors of the tall Javascript tower. He finaly reached the JavaScript Sword at the top level, after beating evil warriors, cruel wizards, letal archers and rescuing captives. It was a funny way to use ecma6 javascript. In order to finish the game you're forced to use cool features, like higher order functions used by the array.prototype methods. Here's the code I wrote.

I called my warrior Balder as one of the Thor saga characters. Balder (and all the others) was drawn in an epic way by Walt Simonson. It's my personal tribute to this legendary cartoonist.
